## 🎯 UPLOAD TO GITHUB - 3 SIMPLE STEPS

### ⏱️ Total Time: ~6 minutes

---

## STEP 1: Create Repository on GitHub (2 minutes)

1. **Open your browser** and go to:  
   https://github.com/new

2. **Fill in the form:**
   - **Repository name:** `IT23648340`
   - **Description:** (optional) `Comprehensive Tamil transliteration test suite with 35 Playwright tests`
   - **Visibility:** Choose **Public** ✓
   - **Initialize this repository with:**  
     ⚠️ **DO NOT CHECK ANYTHING** - leave all unchecked!

3. **Click:** "Create repository"

4. **You'll see an empty repository page** with a URL like:
   ```
   https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/IT23648340
   ```

---

## STEP 2: Push Your Code to GitHub (3 minutes)

Open **PowerShell** in your project folder:

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\kiyan\OneDrive\Desktop\New folder\New folder"
```

Then run these commands ONE BY ONE:

### Command 1: Add Remote
Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username:

```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/IT23648340.git
```

**Expected:** No output (that's normal - means success)

### Command 2: Verify Remote
```powershell
git remote -v
```

**Expected output:**
```
origin  https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/IT23648340.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/IT23648340.git (push)
```

### Command 3: Rename Branch
```powershell
git branch -M main
```

**Expected:** No output (branch renamed locally)

### Command 4: Push to GitHub
```powershell
git push -u origin main
```

**Expected output (first time):**
```
Enumerating objects: ...
Counting objects: 100% (...)
Writing objects: 100% (...)
...
 * [new branch]      main -> main
Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'.
```

✅ **If you see the above, your upload is SUCCESSFUL!**
